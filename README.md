## About What's the Weather Like

`What's the Weather Like` is a Python data analytics endeavor consisting of two parts:
1) 'WeatherPy' pulls (Open Weather API, Google Geocode API), filters, and visualizes world weather data to discover underlying trends with latitude vs. weather.
2) 'VacationPy' filters for cities based on predefined "ideal" weather conditions, visualizes a heatmap using GMaps, and queries and plots the nearest hotels to said cities.

This project builds on the skills from the `matplotlib-challenge` [here]().

## Built with
- Python
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Citipy

## Technical Techniques
- API request, response storing
- Cleaning, sorting, filtering
- Plotting and subplotting (scatter, line, marker, heatmap)
- Linear regression

## Qualitative Techniques
- Synthesizing results for tentative conclusions
- Acknowledging potential pitfalls with results and techniques
